# sim-sdk

The `sim-sdk` provides the interfaces, types, and registration utilities required to build plugins for the NeuroSim Simulation Engine.

## ‚ú® Overview

This SDK allows third-party developers to create simulation plugins that:

- Define custom message types and behaviors
- Handle their own encoding/decoding and validation
- Register new components (devices, systems) and transports
- Participate in a unified simulation timeline managed by the core engine

## üì¶ Features

- Plugin lifecycle hooks (`Init`, `Shutdown`)
- Message registration and schema support
- Component definition for simulation actors
- Streaming (SSE) and event injection support
- Transport abstraction for real vs simulated connectivity

## üèóÔ∏è Plugin Architecture

Each plugin is compiled as an isolated Go binary and communicates with the simulation core via gRPC and a well-defined SDK interface.
